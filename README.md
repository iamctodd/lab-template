# mm-react-lab

A base repo that provides the oauth flow to MM and sets up the boilerplate for using Apollo to access data via GraphQL and other APIs.

## Getting Started

- Pull the repo.
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Don't commit `.env`. It's in `.gitignore` for a reason.
- Set the `REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID` and `REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` variables in `.env`.
- Run `yarn install`
- Run `yarn start`
